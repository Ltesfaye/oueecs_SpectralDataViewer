# Ohio University Spectrometer Data Collection Android App
This Application is a work in progress research project by Sam Foucart and Zach Hughes for Ohio university. This application will over time grow to be able to collect data from an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrometer. 

# Usage
To use the app, clone the repository and build it with Android Studio. The app is tested on a Samsung Galaxy J3. This app must also be run alongside a bluetooth server on another device. To use it with [our sample server](https://github.com/samfoucart/Spectrometer-Data-Collection), run the testSDP.py with super user privileges. testSDP.py is dependent on libbluetooth-dev and the pybluez library.
